The file Assets/csc.rsp prompts Unity's C# compiler to write the documentation for the project code to a file called documentation.xml.
This is the cause of "Missing XML comment for publicly visible type or member" warnings in the console.

It's ideal to resolve such warnings for code that we write ourselves by adding documentation to that code. 
Once that's done and the compiler has written the latest documentation to documentation.xml, 
it is fine to temporarily remove Assets/csc.rsp to avoid the compiler warnings for the code we didn't write ourselves.
